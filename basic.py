print("I'm programming in Python!")
#Here is your output:
#I'm programming in Python!

#Nice job! You just programmed a script in Python that says
#that you are programming in Python, which is pretty meta.
#It also means you just wrote your first Python script and
#got your computer to do what you want.  Feels pretty great,
#right?
